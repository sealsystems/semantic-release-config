# semantic-release

Semantic Release executable and configuration for SEAL Systems

## Getting started

First, you have to install the module as a development dependency:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @sealsystems/semantic-release
```

Please note:

- In order to install all dependencies directly in the project's `node_modules` folder, you may need to delete `package-lock.json` before adding this package.

The following release configurations are available:

- Generic release
- Node.js module
- Node.js binary

### Generic release

This configuration is used to create a release on GitHub. It updates the CHANGELOG.md, created a release tag, and publishes the release on the release page.  

To create binary releases, insert the following lines into your package.json:

```
"release": {
  "extends": "@sealsystems/semantic-release/generic",
}
```

### Node.js module

This configuration is used for Node.js modules. It performs the same steps as a binary release. In addition it also uploads the new release to a NPM registry.

To release a Node.js module, insert the following lines into your package.json:

```
"release": {
  "extends": "@sealsystems/semantic-release/node-module"
}
```

### Node.js binary

This configuration is used for Node.js executables (e.g. services). It performs almost the same steps as a module release excapt for publishing it on NPM.

To release a Node.js binary, insert the following lines into your package.json:

```
"release": {
  "extends": "@sealsystems/semantic-release/node-binary"
}
```

## Calling the release script

This module provides an NPM executable that calls `semantic-release`. To use it, add the following to the script section of your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "release": "release",
}
```

Now, your CI server can run it:

```bash
npm run release
```
